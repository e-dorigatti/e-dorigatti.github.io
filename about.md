My name is Emilio, I studied Computer Science and Data Science, now doing a Ph.D. in statistics applied to
Computational Immunology (i.e. studying how the body fights diseases).

I plan to write about my research because I believe that disseminating our work, especially to outsiders,
is an important part of being a scientist (there is good evidence showing that journalists cannot be trusted).
