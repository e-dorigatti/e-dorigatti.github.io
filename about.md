My name is Emilio, I studied Computer Science and Data Science, now doing a Ph.D. in statistics applied to
Computational Immunology (i.e. studying how the body fights diseases).

I plan to write about my research because I believe that disseminating our work, especially to outsiders,
is an important part of being a scientist (there is good evidence showing that journalists cannot be trusted).

If you find mistakes, imprecisions, incomplete articles, feel like something is missing, want me to discuss
a certain topic, want to ask a question, etc., do not hesitate to [open an issue on GitHub](
https://github.com/e-dorigatti/e-dorigatti.github.io/issues) or contact me at emilio _dot_ dorigatti _at_ gmail _dot_ com.
