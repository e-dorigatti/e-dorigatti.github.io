My name is Emilio, I am a PhD student in statistics applied to computational
immunology. In other words, I use mathematics to study how the body fights
diseases. Previously, I studied computer science and data science, and I have a
minor degree in innovation & entrepreneurship.

I plan to write about my research because I believe that disseminating our work,
especially to outsiders, is an important part of being a scientist. I will also
write about general topics that interest me, taking the chance to learn new
things and teach what I learned.

If you find mistakes, imprecisions, incomplete articles, feel like something is
missing, want me to discuss a certain topic, want to ask a question, etc., do
not hesitate to [open an issue on GitHub](
https://github.com/e-dorigatti/e-dorigatti.github.io/issues) or contact me at
emilio _dot_ dorigatti _at_ gmail _dot_ com.
