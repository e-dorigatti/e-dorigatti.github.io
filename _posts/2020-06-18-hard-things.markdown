Next time you hear somebody saying that artificial intelligence is flawed
because it requires millions of examples to learn anything while humans only
need very few, resist the urge of kicking them in the teeth and show them this list
instead.

These 50 people were among the best, if not _the_ best, of their respective
fields. I am sure you realize this list could be much longer, but I hope it gets
the point across. Sure, there are many things that humans can learn quickly and
easily compared to current artificial intelligence systems, but not recognizing
the importance of a lifetime's worth of experiences and millions of years of
evolution is just silly.

PS: I apologize that there are very few women/blacks in this list. This is a
reflection of my own ignorance, and not a denial of the unquestionable
contributions women/blacks brought to humankind. If you are particularly
bothered by this, [contact me](/about) and provide a few examples you would like
to be included.
