Last month, a new epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread all over
the world. As of now, there are reports of a few companies rushing to develop,
or having already developed, a vaccine for this virus[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]. Thanks
to recent technological progress, the development of new vaccines is fairly
quick, and clinical trials can start only a few months after the pathogen was
sequenced.

However, availability of a vaccine to the public will be delayed by the clinical
trials necessary to ensure the vaccine works as intended and is not harmful. The
expected time-span for these tests is one or two years, as animal testing must
precede human testing. The issue is that vaccines behave slightly differently in
humans and in animals (usually mice and/or monkeys). In the early stages of
research, vaccines that worked well in animals were much weaker in humans. In
addition, vaccines can cause inflammation. Slight inflammation is good, and
makes the vaccine more effective, but strong inflammation can be
counterproductive and outright harmful. Because of differences between humans
and animals, a vaccine can be toxic for us but not for them (and vice-versa, but
in this case the vaccine would never be tested in humans).

Unfortunately I could not find any scientific publications about these alleged
vaccines, likely because of all the commercial interest behind them,[^5] [^6]
but most news sources seem to agree on the fact that it will be either a mRNA or
a DNA vaccine. These kind of vaccines are designed from scratch to match the
biological signature of a pathogen, without including unnecessary, and
potentially toxic, proteins. Developing these kind of vaccines is much easier,
as it does not require interacting with live pathogens, and they can be
manufactured cheaply.

Several articles have been published on biorxiv on the topic,[^7] and the
article that first shared the sequences of this virus has been read more than
150 000 times since it was posted seven days
ago.[^zhouDiscoveryNovelCoronavirus2020] As I said above, these sequences are
fundamental to develop drugs. There were several works modeling the outbreak and
studying how the virus spread, estimating the number of undiscovered cases and
the infectivity of the virus.[^chenMathematicalModelSimulating2020]
[^liuTransmissionDynamics20192020]

Others are comparing this strain of Coronavirus with old strains that caused
outbreaks in the past, finding very good agreement between the sequences, or at
least the parts essential for the life cycle of the virus (called SARS-Cov).
This is great news: it means that drugs developed for those strains can possibly
work directly on the new Coronavirus, or require little adaptation. This in turn
means that clinical testing is not necessary, as these drugs have already been
tested. For now, several existing drugs have been identified as effective
inhibitors or potential therapeutics,[^xuNelfinavirWasPredicted2020]
[^liTherapeuticDrugsTargeting2020] [^liuPotentialInhibitors2019nCoV2020]
[^tianPotentBinding20192020] which might speed up general availability as they
have already undergone clinical trials.

In the next weeks, I will try to follow these developments and keep this post
updated. I hope to learn more about how vaccines are developed, as it is [very
relevant to my PhD]({% post_url 2019-08-16-what_is_my_phd_about %}), and
watching this process unfold live is fascinating.
