In this post, I am going to reflect on my past six months as a PhD student: what
went right, what went wrong, what was good, and what was bad.

## Overview
For a detailed description of the topic of my PhD, see [this post]({% post_url
2019-08-16-what_is_my_phd_about %}) I wrote some time ago. Briefly, I study new
ways to develop personalized vaccines, targeted to specific patients and
diseases. For this semester, I am also in charge of the exercises for a course
on Deep Learning offered to Master students of the statistics program of my
university. I am employed at the LMU university and a guest scientist at the
Institute for Computational Biology (ICB). I have two supervisors coming from
those institutions, who help me with the methods (machine learning and discrete
optimization) and subject matter (biology and immunology). This is the scheme
devised by my graduate school, [MuDS](https://mu-ds.de/).

## Summary
I actually start with the conclusion, leaving the details for later. In general,
I am really enjoying the experience: life as a PhD student aligns perfectly to
my values of autonomy, competence, and reasonableness. I am also lucky to have
two very good supervisors that are knowledgeable and not bossy.

So far, the good things are:

 - Research diary: it really helps me stay focused and organized. I am glad I
   started since the beginning. I am also happy of the tools I use, as they give
   me a lot of freedom to organize and re-organize things as I see fit.
 - Progress: I already submitted a paper and working on the next one. I also
   collaborated on a third project, although I had a minor part, which is going
   to be published soon. My supervisors are idea factories, so work is never
   lacking.
 - Teaching: I really enjoy the teaching experience, especially being in the
   classroom and interacting with the students. Creating the exercise sheets
   does not take that much time, but I got mixed feedback on them. On the one
   hand, they are well done and useful, on the other hand they are too hard and
   too long. This latter point is mostly due to the way they are presented, and
   giving more hints should be enough.

Some things which are not so good:

 - Reading: it took me some time to get into systematic reading habits, mostly
   because, entering a new field, I had to look for good sources. I also was not
   very organized in how I learned about this new field, mostly reading bits and
   pieces whenever I needed them. However, I have improved on this and I am
   satisfied with the system I found.
 - Collaborations: I have been working alone for the two major projects I
   described above, and I my part in the soon-to-be-published one was during a
   five-days hackathon. I have always been a lone wolf, and I do not mind
   working alone, but I should really improve my collaboration and team working
   skills. Not to mention that I could learn tons of things from people I
   collaborate with. I also wish to improve my non-existent leadership skills,
   which could only happen by being in the driving seat for a project.
 - Belonging to two research groups: it has positive and negative sides,
   mentioning it here does not mean that I am not satisfied and want to change
   this. The problem with it is that it requires more interactions with more
   people. Being an introvert by nature, a lot of social interaction can be a
   drain on my energy. It also means more meetings. The positive side is, of
   course, being exposed to a very diverse set of topics and people
   (statisticians and biologists), which I find very intellectually stimulating.

Things that caused me some difficulty:

 - Method evaluation: before starting this PhD, I thought that most of the
   effort went into thinking and developing a new method, then some effort into
   performing experiments, and a little to write and publish the paper. Was I
   wrong! Turns out that having new ideas and improving on the state of the art
   is not a big deal, and the implementation is also more or less
   straightforward. Evaluating new methods is not very hard _per se_, but what I
   am finding difficult is to come up with good experiments to show where this
   method is good, and when/why it is to be preferred over the alternatives. I
   never liked being a salesman, I thought people can be rational and able to
   objectively evaluate and choose the better method, and that if an idea is
   good it would be self-evident, without need of further proof. Wrong! You
   literally have to smash it in their face. Put less emphasis on _these are all
   the cool things you can do with our new method_, and focus on _look at how
   much better you can do these things with our new method_. It makes a big
   difference. Finally, writing the paper can take as much time as everything
   else, even without factoring the delay caused by peer review.
 - Procrastination: when you have so much independence, it is sometimes easy to
   keep postponing certain things you do not like, such as performing
   experiments just for the sake of proving how much better you are. Acting like
   this, in general, is not in my character, so I felt uncomfortable entering
   into this mindset, creating some delays in the project. The recipe to fight
   procrastination is easy: set clear deadlines, keep your peers and supervisors
   informed, and, most importantly, hold yourself accountable. The last part can
   be as simple as giving yourself prizes when things get done in time, and deny
   yourself pleasures when things are not going too well.

Finally, the action points to tackle these issues are:

 - Spend more time reading. Simple. Once the Deep Learning course is over, I
   plan to devote that time to systematically read books about the fundamentals
   on math, statistics and biology. This strategy was suggested by my
   supervisor, as opposed to participating to courses at university. I am
   explicitly encouraged to spend time learning and improving my skills, and I
   _really_ appreciate this.
 - Find interesting people to collaborate with. Good people are more important
   than good projects. The goal is to learn from them. This is also simple on
   paper: just meet a lot of people and talk with them about our interests. It
   is not something that comes natural to me, but it is becoming easier.
 - Do another retrospective. Self-reflection is the only way to get better at
   things you struggle with.

## Professional development
Before starting my PhD, I was keen on working on my soft skills, such as team
work, leadership, and communication, while putting less emphasis on technical
skills. I do not intend to stop learning new things, far from it, but now I have
reached a point where acquiring new technical skills is just a matter of course:
just like cooking dinner, it must be done, and it is more or less done in the
same way every time.

In the past six months, I have been working a lot on communication: I started
this blog (which, as far as I know, nobody reads), I teach at university (just a
mere TA), I share my research with presentations, posters and scientific
articles (nothing got published yet). Communication sure takes a lot of effort!
The only feedback I received was about teaching, not only about the exercises
but also about my presence in the classroom, which is, in general, good. I am
helpful and cooperative, and I stimulate interest in the subject. There are
mixed feelings about my ability to make difficult things understandable, which
is something I value and should improve. I am looking forward to see the reviews
of the article I submitted, I would be happy if there were no misunderstandings
due to sloppy writing.

I have not achieved much in terms of collaborations, team work and leadership,
the only relevant event being the hackathon in Dresden. It was definitely a
positive experience, in the end, but I feel like my leadership was a bit
lacking. I did have the respect of the others, but I made them waste some time
on useless work. I do not consider myself good in dealing with stressful, high
pressure situations, possibly because I lack the quick intuition, coming from
experience, of what is the right thing to do. However, I am not too worried
about my lack of collaborations. After all, this is a completely new
environment for me, and I did not know anybody when I started.

## Research diary
I try to keep a research diary, logging what I do every day, how I spend my
time, and to take notes. This really helps me stay focused and in control of my
time and energy. I use [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) for
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (well, actually,
[Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/)), which can be seen as an extended
Markdown, very well integrated into Emacs. In particular, its facilities to
[clock working
time](https://orgmode.org/manual/Clocking-Work-Time.html#Clocking-Work-Time)
make time tracking effortless. Briefly, below every heading there is a list that
contains dates and times of when I worked on that item. These intervals are
maintained automatically by various commands in Emacs, so that I only need to
_clock in_ when I start working on something and _clock out_ when I stop. For
example, this is a snippet coming from my diary, where I removed unnecessary
text:

```
* Teaching
** Deep Learning WS 19/20
*** Labs
**** Lab 7
     :LOGBOOK:
     CLOCK: [2019-12-20 Fri 09:09]--[2019-12-20 Fri 10:08] =>  0:59
     CLOCK: [2019-12-18 Wed 08:45]--[2019-12-18 Wed 09:46] =>  1:01
     CLOCK: [2019-12-17 Tue 13:02]--[2019-12-17 Tue 18:13] =>  5:11
     CLOCK: [2019-12-17 Tue 10:02]--[2019-12-17 Tue 11:43] =>  1:41
     :END:
```

Where section headers are specified with several `*` (the equivalent of
Markdown's `#`), and the `LOGBOOK` section is maintained by Emacs with the
commands I mentioned above.

Emacs can automatically produce [time
reports](https://orgmode.org/manual/The-clock-table.html) based on the time
clocking information. I assess my progress by looking at weekly/biweekly/monthly
reports every Monday before the stand-up meeting with the rest of the group,
where I do a brief, informal and personal stand-up. I also use the
[agenda](https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-views.html) to keep track of which
items to work on, although my use of this functionality is still very basic.

The main sections in my research diary are:

 - Research: contains all the projects I work on, and every project contains
   information the main work items to be done: implementation, evaluation, the
   paper, presentations, posters, and so on. Each of these can contain further
   sub-topics, as needed.
 - Teaching: for now, this only contains the Deep Learning course which I am
   TA'ing. I keep track of the time needed to make the exercises for the
   students, to attend classes, as well as other administrative matters such as
   updating the website and helping with the slides (which are mostly done by
   other PhDs)
 - Learning: in most cases, I do not keep track of _what_ exactly I learn, I
   only register the time I spend on learning. The reason is that I prefer to
   directly annotate the PDF of the papers I read (if I decide it is worth to
   read more than the abstract). I take notes when I attend seminars and journal
   clubs, and when I watch lectures on youtube.
 - Meetings: I have an item for every meeting, at least to clock the time. Often
   I take notes during the meeting itself, and for important meetings I also use
   this area to write my thoughts and outline a rough agenda before the meeting
   happens.
 - Events: this refers to conferences, retreats, and hackathons.
 - Administration: just to make sure I do not forget about paperwork.

Overall I am very satisfied about this diary, and I think my life would be
considerably messier without it. Being text-based, unexpectedly, turns out to be
a huge advantage: I can sort and re-order things however I please (I needed
several iterations before finding a comfortable way of organizing things), and I
am not limited by an arbitrary maximum depth for my items. Like many other
things, it has a steeper learning curve compared to the mainstream dumbed-down
solutions, but the benefits are well worth it.

## Working time analysis
In this section I look at and comment on the time I spent on various activities.
Below, I show a time report generated by Emacs, that I edited for clarity,
removing irrelevant sections. I also added links to the relevant events or the
organizations responsible, so that you know what I am talking about.

In total, I clocked 625 hours and 13 minutes. The "canonical" working time would
approximately be eight hours a day, five days a week, four weeks per month, for
six months, i.e. 960 hours. This means that I accounted for 65% of the time I am
supposed to be working, or an average of five hours per day instead of eight.
This is consistent with my gut feeling, but the figure has to be taken with a
grain of salt for a couple of reasons:

 1. I did not start with this system straight away, especially at the beginning
    I was not clocking everything I did (for example, the paperwork needed to
    enroll to the university. It is not as simple as it sounds). I started
    clocking consistently three or four months ago, and even today there are
    some periods that do I not count. One of the most important examples is the
    time I spend wondering what I should be working on.
 2. I am not working in an assembly line, and staying _really_ focused and
    productive for eight hours every day is simply not feasible. Although it
    does not produce immediate gains, taking some time off to recap the work
    done, recent learnings, and the path ahead is much more important than
    pretending to be busy. I am not afraid to call it a day when I am stuck a
    few hours after lunch. Time away from the keyboard is essential to take a
    step back, look at the big picture, and find another way forward.

Now, what have I achieved in these 620 hours / six months?

 - I (almost) completed an entire project: the idea came from my supervisor, but
   I did the implementation and the evaluation, wrote half of the paper, etc.
   This is under the _Generalized EV Design_ headline, which I covered in
   [another blog post]({% post_url 2019-11-18-the_first_project_of_my_phd %}).
   This paper is currently (beginning of January) being reviewed, and it is very
   likely that more work will be needed before it gets published, but still.
   Note that the headline _compare our approach with others_ includes a lot of
   changes and improvements performed after the main idea was implemented,
   simply because these comparisons brought up new and unexpected perspectives.
 - I am about one third of the way on another project (the _Spacers_), and this
   time I had the idea myself (I tend to discount the project above as I
   "simply" implemented it. Thank you [impostor
   syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)). The core of the
   project is already implemented and tested, what is missing is an evaluation
   and comparison with other approaches in the literature, as well as writing
   the paper.
 - The Deep Learning hackathon in Dresden resulted in another, now mostly
   complete, project that [was
   presented](https://indico.cern.ch/event/773049/contributions/3474758/) at the
   _Conference on Computing in High Energy & Nuclear Physics_ (CHEP 2019).
   During the hackathon I helped a team of physicists to use a graph
   convolutional neural network to classify particle decay events as
   "interesting" or "not interesting" (for their purposes at least). We are
   working on a paper about this. They did most of the job, such as preparing
   the data and a more thorough evaluation, I only helped them with the Deep
   Learning part (it was a five days event after all).
 - I created seven exercise sheets for the Deep Learning course. Each sheet
   contains three exercises, a mix of practical and theoretical ones. This was
   my first serious experience using the R programming language, I think I could
   have done the exercises in half the time if I was allowed to use Python. Many
   exercises were inspired to old material and to Bishop's _Neural networks for
   pattern recognition_, which, although dated, is solid on the fundamentals,
   and I also proposed exercises that I found invaluable while I was learning
   the topic.
 - Other unquantifiable gains, such as knowledge and professional network.

Some comments on my time allocation are due:

 - The time I spent in meetings feels a lot more than 10%. The reason is that a
   badly scheduled meeting can disrupt a whole morning or afternoon. Just like
   every other technical worker, I dread meetings and I wish they could be kept
   to a minimum. I am also in a particular situation because I am part of two
   working groups, which means that I have more meetings than usual. Moving
   between different working places also takes considerable time; for example,
   every Thursday I would spend two and a half hours commuting, I had one
   meeting in the late morning and one in the early afternoon. Thursday was
   never a productive day.
 - Almost one third of time spent on events is way too much, although two thirds
   of this time was for mandatory events which could not be avoided. A lot of
   them took place in September and October, and indeed in those months I was
   feeling very unproductive (also because the Deep Learning course had just
   started). The MUDS course lasted two whole weeks, and was mostly a waste of
   time.
 - Only four percent of my time was spent on learning! This is embarassingly
   low, but I needed several months to find good sources of relevant research. I
   have been reading systematically only in the past few months, dealing with 3
   to 5 articles in 20 to 40 minutes every day. Also, I often read while
   commuting (Janeway's _Immunobiology_), although this time is never clocked
   in. Once the Deep Learning course is over, I plan to use that time to
   seriously read more books, starting from Strang's _Linear algebra and
   learning from data_.
 - 58 hours for 7 exercise sheets makes slightly more than eight hours per
   sheet, plus two more hours for my physical presence in the classroom means
   around ten ours per week. It is slightly more than what I am supposed to
   spend on it (i.e., eight hours), but the next labs will be quicker to do as
   my students complained that the exercises so far are useful and stimulating,
   but too long and complicated (lazy youngsters...). Also note that I am
   attending regular lessons to align what is done in the labs and what is said
   in the lecture. I have not studied at this university nor in this country
   (and, consequently, I did not know how good a professor my supervisor is), so
   I think this time is well spent.

To sum up, although I do not always work the "canonical" eight hours per day, I
made good progress in my research. The exercises I made for Deep Learning are
high quality and well received, except for their length, both by my students and
by my supervisor. I should spend more time learning, which will happen once that
course is done. On paper, I do not spend much time in meetings, but in practice
it feels much more. I also had to participate to several events, some of them
more useful than other.
